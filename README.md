(currently under revision in eNeuro).
This study describes and analyses extensively the performance of an algorithm developed for the automated detection of synaptic vesicles in transmission electron microscopy (EM) images. The algorithm is freely available and can be found at: https://github.com/Imbrosci/synaptic-vesicles-detection.
For running the file ROC_AUC_calculator.py it is necessary to get the trained model (model.pth) at: https://github.com/Imbrosci/synaptic-vesicles-detection/blob/master/vesicles_analysis/model.pth. Alternatively, it can be used to test one's own trained model.
